# Java-Inheritance-and-Polymorphism-Practice
his project is a simple Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise designed to demonstrate the use of inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism through geometric shapes. It defines a generic abstract class Shape, and specific subclasses Circle, Square, and Triangle, each providing their own implementations for computing area and perimeter.
