# Java Inheritance and Polymorphism Practice

## Description

This project is a simple **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise** designed to demonstrate the use of **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism** through geometric shapes. It defines a generic abstract class `Shape`, and specific subclasses `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`, each providing their own implementations for computing area and perimeter.

The main class, `IT2344Practice01.java`, serves as the entry point to instantiate and manipulate these shape objects—showcasing dynamic method dispatch and encapsulation in action.

This project is ideal for students or beginners looking to solidify their understanding of core OOP principles in Java.

## Features

* 🔷 Abstract base class `Shape` with abstract methods
* ⚪ `Circle`, ◼ `Square`, and 🔺 `Triangle` subclasses with custom implementations
* 📐 Area and perimeter calculations using overridden methods
* 🧠 Demonstrates polymorphism via dynamic method calls
* 🧪 Structured for easy testing and practice

## Technologies Used

* Java SE
* NetBeans or any Java IDE
* No external dependencies

## Learning Objectives

* Understand and implement class inheritance
* Use abstract classes and method overriding
* Apply polymorphism in real-world object models
* Reinforce encapsulation and code reuse

## Sample Structure

```bash
.
├── Shape.java         # Abstract class
├── Circle.java        # Circle subclass
├── Square.java        # Square subclass
├── Triangle.java      # Triangle subclass
└── IT2344Practice01.java  # Main class with test logic
```
